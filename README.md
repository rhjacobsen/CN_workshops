#  Computer Networks Course Workshops
This repository contains materials for the workshops in the computer engineering bachelor course in Computer Networks at Aarhus University.

The workshops are made for the GNS3 simulator. GNS3 is open source, free software that you can download from [http://gns3.com](http://gns3.com). It allows the creation of virtual networks of hosts, switches and routers among other network appliances. There is a good amount of [documentation for GNS3](https://docs.gns3.com/). 

When you have installed the GNS3, I recommend that you proceed to create [your first GNS3 topology](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-gns3-topology/#!) following the guidelines to get to know the GNS3 GUI and to see if the GNS3 is installed correctly.

To successfully run the GNS3 simulator, there are some [hardware requirements](#hw_reqs) to consider. GNS3 is supported on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It comes with a bundled of various prerequisite and optional software such as the Wireshark protocol analyzer. So far I have only tested the installation on Windows 10.

### Guide for installation of the environment

GNS3 is said to run on the Windows, Linux and the MacOS platform. It supports virtualization with VMware, Virtual Box and Hyper-V technology. The guide below brings you through the installation on Windows 10 using Hyper-V virtualization.
